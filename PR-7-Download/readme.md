## Project Conductance

The project is organized into separate folders, each containing a self-contained HTML file for a specific functionality. All applications use Bootstrap for responsive design and enhanced UI components. JavaScript is used for dynamic behavior, such as timers, progress updates, and interactive quizzes.

**How to Run:**
1. Open any of the HTML files ([Download&Watch/Download-Watch.html](Download&Watch/Download-Watch.html), [Quize/quize.html](Quize/quize.html), [Quotes/quotes.html](Quotes/quotes.html)) in your web browser.
2. Interact with the UI as described above for each module.

**Purpose:**  
This project demonstrates practical JavaScript skills, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and UI feedback, in the context of real-world mini-
